# WinterBreak2019

Project Ideas:
1. Google Practice (The "right" way to google) Have some things that students will have to google to find the answer to
=> Google Dorking: https://gist.github.com/sundowndev/283efaddbcf896ab405488330d1bbc06 , https://www.cybrary.it/0p3n/google-dorks-easy-way-of-hacking/ 

2. HTML/CSS/Flexbox/Less Practice - supply the HTML and design files and have students go in and mark up HTML, then for one Project use CSS to style, and for another use LESS to style (to get practice with both)

3. JavaScript practice - JavaScript problems to practice what we've learned this week, maybe a quiz at the end for students to do to prepare for JavaScript Assessment

4. Have Students Fork and Clone assignment and use their own branches

5. Possibly a big assignment that each person can work on something and merge to master to create a final product (may need another Repo for this)

6. Mixins & Variables Practice (for the same consistent style throughout the web page)

7. Possibly a website consisted of 7 pages, one for each student, that each student can go in and style and merge into one big project to deploy in the end
